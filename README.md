# Requirements

1. python
2. some simple common sense
3. slight cmd prompt knowledge (optional)

# how to use (tutorial)
its easy asf

# step 1: 
go here: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ and download the windows installer for 3.12.4
when the installation is downloaded, open it, **AND CHECK THE OPTION TO ADD TO PATH**, then continue the installation.

# step 2:
come back here (aka github) and download the file by clicking the code button > download zip file
when the file is downloaded, extract it, and open the new extracted folder (aka the new folder)

# step 3:
open cmd prompt
type `cd` and add a space at the end, then drag the new folder into the cmd prompt.
it should now look smth like this: `cd C:\Users\(your user)\Desktop\spacenuker`
press enter and then type `pip install -r requirements.txt`
it takes a bit of time but it does get downloaded.

# bugs in step 3:
if the pip cmd diddnt work then you probably fucked up in step 1

# step 4:
edit the config file IF U WANT and open the cmd prompt again
type `cd C:\Users\(your user)\Desktop\spacenuker` again
now type `main.py` and press enter. 

# tutorial done :D
yay
